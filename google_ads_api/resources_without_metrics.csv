"billing_setup,customer","<p>An account-level budget. It contains information about the budget itself, as well as the most recently approved changes to the budget and proposed changes that are pending approval. The proposed changes that are pending approval, if any, are found in 'pending_proposal'. Effective details about the budget are found in fields prefixed 'approved_', 'adjusted_' and those without a prefix. Since some effective details may differ from what the user had originally requested (for example, spending limit), these differences are juxtaposed through 'proposed_', 'approved_', and possibly 'adjusted_' fields. This resource is mutated using AccountBudgetProposal and cannot be mutated directly. A budget may have at most one pending proposal at any given time. It is read through pending_proposal. Once approved, a budget may be subject to adjustments, such as credit adjustments. Adjustments create differences between the 'approved' and 'adjusted' fields, which would otherwise be identical.</p>",Account Budget
